Ninja has an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’. He recently created a topic ‘Complete Sum’ and defined the term ‘completeSum[i]’ = Sum ( A[0] … A[i] ).

Output the complete sum array of array ‘A’.

Example :
N = 3
A = [ 1, 2, 3 ] 

Explanation : 

Complete sum for index 0 is ‘A[0]=1’.

Complete sum for index 1 is ‘A[0] + A[1]’ = 3.

Complete sum for index 2 is ‘A[0] + A[1] + A[2]’ = 6.

So, we output [ 1, 3, 6 ].
Input Format :
The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The second line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the size of array ‘A’.

The third line of each test case contains ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of array ‘A’.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the complete sum array for array ‘A’.

Print the output of each test case in a new line.
Note :
You don’t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 10^4

Time Limit : 1 sec
